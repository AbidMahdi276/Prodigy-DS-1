# Population Analysis using Tableau 
In this project, population data of India and China from 2011-2022 was collected and was analyzed and visualized using Tableau with the help of Histograms and Bar graphs with the average line showing the growth rate of population in India and China respectively from 2011 to 2022, and how India overtook China in population. 
The distribution between the sexes, i.e., Male and Female is also represented by the given legend in the Tableau file, from the year 2011-2022 separately of both the countries, India and China, which portrays the growth of individual sexes of both the countries. 
Therefore, in conclusion, from 2011-2016 India was trailing from China in population. 
But soon after 2016, India's marginal growth rate was more than China's growth rate of population, which resulted in India being the most populous country in the world in 2022.
